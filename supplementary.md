## DSSL2

In addition to the parts of the documentation you will find
particularly helpful, including

- [Syntax](https://docs.racket-lang.org/dssl2/Lexical_syntax.html)
- [Statements](https://docs.racket-lang.org/dssl2/stm-forms.html) including `class` and `struct`
- [Expressions](https://docs.racket-lang.org/dssl2/exp-forms.html)
- [Contracts](https://docs.racket-lang.org/dssl2/Contracts.html)

You should also consult the [language
implementation](https://github.com/tov/dssl2/), which has available a
whole collection of [pre-implemented
libraries](https://github.com/tov/dssl2/tree/main/lib) whose source
you could look at for interesting examples. Download it from Github
and play with it yourself!

### DSSL2 for Java Programmers

Please also find, in the [course website repository]( {{
site.sourceurl }}{{ site.repository}}/tree/master/_code/rosetta_stone), a kind
of "Rosetta stone" for how to read and write DSSL2 code from the
perspective of a Java programmer.

In order to run and test the Java code, assuming you have JDK1.8+
installed and on your path, execute the following:

```bash
javac Main.java; java Main
```
