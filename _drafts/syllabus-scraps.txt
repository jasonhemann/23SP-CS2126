@item{@bold{Functional
correctness}: can you apply data structures and algorithms concepts to
produce implementations that display correct behavior and produce
correct results? @; }
@item{@bold{Non-functional correctness}: can you produce programs that are
  efficient, robust, and maintainable, and demonstrate good programming habits
  and hygiene?
  @;
}
@item{@bold{Theory}: can you understand, apply, and contextualize
  definitions and techniques related to the theoretical aspects of data
  structures and algorithms: computational complexity, invariants, etc.
  @;
}



@item{@bold{Judgements}: can you make informed decisions when picking
  data structures and algorithms and evaluating alternatives?
  @; I will assess your ability to judiciously choose algorithms via the final project.
}

@item{@bold{Integration}: can you combine multiple data structures and
  algorithms to decompose and solve complex problems?
  @; I will assess this via the final project.
